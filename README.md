# Proportional Light

> A Home Assistant Custom Component that Groups multiple lights into one entity that works like Apple Music's multi-room audio controls.

Just like how Apple Music lets you control multiple HomePods as one group while maintaining each speaker's individual volume characteristics, this component lets you control multiple lights as one entity while preserving their individual brightness relationships.

Perfect for rooms with multiple lights where you want simple group control without losing each light's personality.

## What It Does

- **One slider controls all lights** - but each light keeps its individual brightness relationship
- **Kitchen light stays dimmer, living room stays brighter** - just like your HomePods
- **Move the group slider to 50%** - all lights scale down proportionally  
- **Colors and effects work too** - averages colors across all lights
- **Always stays in sync** - change any individual light and the group updates automatically

That's it. Simple group control that respects each light's personality.
