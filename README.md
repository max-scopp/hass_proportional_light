# Proportional Light

> Group lights that keep their personality instead of being boringly identical.

One slider controls all lights, but each keeps its individual character. Kitchen stays dimmer, living room brighter. Just like Apple Music's multi-room controls.

## Add Flair with Hue Offsets

- Each light in the group can have a unique hue offset, adding personality to your lighting.
- For example, setting the group to "Red":
  - Living room: Red + 10° = warm red-orange
  - Kitchen: Red - 20° = cool red-purple
  - Bedroom: Red = pure red
- The group shows the commanded color briefly, then displays the averaged actual colors.
