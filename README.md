# Proportional Light

> Group lights that keep their personality instead of being boringly identical.

One slider controls all lights, but each keeps its individual character. Kitchen stays dimmer, living room brighter. Just like Apple Music's multi-room controls.

## Add Flair with Hue Offsets

**Problem**: Set group to "red" → all lights show the exact same boring red  
**Solution**: Give each light a unique hue offset for personality

- Living room: Red + 10° offset = warm red-orange glow
- Kitchen: Red + (-20°) offset = cool red-purple accent  
- Bedroom: Red + 0° offset = pure red

Same "red" command, but each room gets its own flair.

### Setup
1. Add your colorable lights to the integration
2. Configure → Set hue offsets (-180° to +180°) 
3. Test: Set group to red, see each light's unique interpretation

**Result**: No more identical, sterile lighting. Each room has character.
